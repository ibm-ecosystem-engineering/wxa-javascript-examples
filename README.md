# watsonx Assistant JavaScript Examples

This repo contains a vanilla JS app with an embedded watsonx Assistant. The assistant has a variety of actions with user-defined responses that point to JS components (ex: a Swiper carousel, a Chart.js pie chart). This repo references many examples from: [Assistant Toolkit](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-toolkit/tree/master/integrations/webchat/examples)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

### watsonx Assistant setup

To set up your own assistant, you'll need to perform the steps below.

- The [OpenAPI specification](nbp.openapi.json) for the National Bank of Poland can be used to set up the custom extension in your assistant. For our full docs on how to create and customize extensions, visit [Building a Custom Extension](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-build-custom-extension).
- Import the [wxa-javascript-examples-action.json](wxa-javascript-examples-action.json) file located in the repository for this example into your assistant.
- Modify the `integrationID`, `region`, and `serviceInstanceID` within `app.js` with your assistant's information. This information can be found in your assistant instance under "Environments" -> "Web chat" -> "Embed".
